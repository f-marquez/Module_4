# Module_4

**Background**

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

**This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results.**

  - Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
  - Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
  - Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis (README.md)

  ## Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
  Use the Pandas NumPy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN for ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School
  
  ## Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
  
Repeat the school district analysis you did in this module, and recreate the following metrics:

- The district summary
- The school summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score for each grade level from each school
- The average reading score for each grade level from each school
- The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
  
 ## Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis (README.md)
